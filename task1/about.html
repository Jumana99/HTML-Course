    <p>Being a new introduced American burger restaurant, The Burger Factory has
         possessed certain competitive advantages over the other competitors to grasp the customer 
         preferences. Following by the launching of its third outlet in Damansara, it has successfully 
         raised the public awareness through social media. Hence, it is essential to study the business 
         nature of The Burger Factory to evaluate its business strategy and structure. This requires critical thinking.
